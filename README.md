# YouTube Comment Downloader Script
This repository contains a JavaScript script that downloads comments from a YouTube video page in CSV format. The script extracts the following data from the comment section:
```
Author Name
User Profile ID
Comment ID
Profile Image Link
Comment Text
Video Link
Thumbnail Link
Video Title
Channel Name
```

Once the data is gathered, the script downloads it as a CSV file, allowing easy access to the information.

## How to Use
1. Open a YouTube video page in your web browser.
2. Open the browser developer console `For Windows/Linux Ctrl + Shift + I or F12 and For Mac Command+Option+I`.
3. Copy and paste the entire code of the [**_Script.js_**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HeinrichWinkel/YouTube-Comment-Downloader-Script/main/script.js) into the console.
4. Press Enter to execute the script.

## ❗ Important Note ❗
Before using the script, make sure you have expanded the comment section on the YouTube video page. The script will extract comments only from the expanded comment section.
